This is the HCHS Robotics Team GitHub repository. Our code is based off of the PedroPathing QuickStart ((https://github.com/AnyiLin/Pedro-Pathing-Quickstart)).

# Description
In the TeamCode, in addition to the PedroPathing files, we have our team code. The two files at the time of writing are egt.java and lm1.java. 

The code found in egt.java is the code for our goal robot, at the time of writing, that is LABBS-01.
The code in lm1.java is our code for the bot at we will use for our first League Meet (hence the name).
This bot builds upon the starter bot kit created by GoBilda, adding enhancements such as hang and odometry.
